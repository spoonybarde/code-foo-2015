IGN's Code-Foo 2015
=============
Hey guys! Just thought I'd add a little extra information to what I've done here, because I don't think I've used GitHub properly, and I want to make sure what I've submitted is as clear as possible.

For more information on IGN's Code-Foo 2015, visit [ign.com/code-foo/2015] (http://ign.com/code-foo/2015).

To apply to Code-Foo 2015, fork this repository and answer all questions. Push your answers to your fork and send us an email at ign_code-foo@ign.com to let us know you're finished.

IGN's Code-Foo 2015 is open to US residents only.  All answers must be completed using Java, Scala, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Objective-C, or JavaScript. Application must be turned in by _Friday, May 1st at 5pm PST_. You will be notified by email if you pass the first round of submissions.

1. Create a 2-5 minute video introducing yourself and tell us why we should choose you for the Code-Foo program.

    Uploaded as a link to YouTube in question1. It was taken with my phone and uploaded wirelessly, so the video quality is bad, but I don't sound like I'm in a cardboard tube, which is what would have happened, had I used my webcam. Compromises.

2. How many ping-pong balls can you fit in 747? Describe each step in your thought process.

    Uploaded as a link to an image in question2. I did this fairly early on and I really liked my formatting, so I decided to keep it.

3. Write a program to find the given words from the included word search. Both word search and words can be found at [word-search.txt] (https://github.com/ign/code-foo-2015/blob/master/word-search.txt)

    Uploaded in question3. It's a Java file. You probably can tell that, but I don't know how to indicate that on here. I'm sure there's a way to automate pulling the text from the .txt file, but I didn't see that there was a .txt file available here until I'd already made the program, so I decided to keep it as is. Also, I wish I knew a better way to indicate found words, but their locations should be apparent.

4.  Using [this API] (http://ign-apis.herokuapp.com), pull and display a list of both articles and videos. 

    I'm not sure I did this one right. I uploaded a web-formatted file in question4. I know that, theoretically, I should be able to automate the list, but I couldn't figure out how to do that. Also, I was having issues parsing the JSON arrays with JavaScript due to invalid characters in the strings. I had to manually insert '\' to make them all valid. Again, I know there's a way to do this automatically, but I couldn't figure it out. 

5. Using the results from the previous question, create a web/ios/android application that displays the results and matches [this design] (https://github.com/ign/code-foo-2015/blob/master/design.png). The application should be responsive to common screen/device sizes.

    This one is also pretty bad, but I simply ran out of time. It looks okay in my browser, but I don't even know if it will translate to other browsers. I know I can make variable widths in CSS according to the type of device viewing the page, but I didn't get that far. The width of it should be small enough that more modern smartphones/tablets won't have an issue viewing the entire thing, I think. I'm probably going to keep messing with this one to try to get it to work, even after submitting this, because I really just ran out of time.

Bonus Question
--------------
Programmatically create a game similar to Battleshipâ„¢ with one AI-controlled opponent and a human-controlled player.

  Uploaded as bonus. Again, another Java file, which you guys probably know. I had a lot of fun with this one! I could have made it cooler, had I had more time, but again, loads of fun making this. I'm overselling. I just hope it doesn't crash, because I worked really hard to get all the bugs out.
